<h2 align="center">Description</h2>
Database Backup Manager is a backup of databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL or MongoDB. 
The backup can then be uploaded to any destination such as a local path or server using FTP/S, SMB, SSH or to cloud services such as S3 storage, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box or Microsoft Azure.
Of course, you can also configure notifications, which can then be sent to Discord, email, webhook or other providers. 

The software is developed in the Python and uses Docker to support it on all platforms.
There is a modern web UI where you can configure and manage everything. 
It should be a good and easy user experience.

<h2 align="center">We are looking for developers!</h2>

The following programming languages and frameworks are used in this project:
HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, Docker
